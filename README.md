# My AI Usage

This project includes transparent documentation of how AI tools were used during development.

### Tools Used

* ChatGPT (OpenAI)
* GitHub Copilot

### How These Tools Were Used

* I used ChatGPT to debug issues with authentication, admin permissions, and CORS configuration.
* ChatGPT was used to generate and refine backend controller functions, middleware structure, and API routing logic.
* ChatGPT helped in writing React components, improving API integration, and building CRUD functionalities for sweets.
* GitHub Copilot assisted in auto-completing JavaScript functions, generating repetitive code patterns, and providing inline suggestions while coding in VS Code.

### Reflection on AI Impact

AI tools improved my development speed and reduced time spent debugging. They helped in structuring backend logic, improving frontend state management, and refining my understanding of authentication flow.
However, I made sure to manually review all code generated by AI and modify it according to the project requirements. AI acted as an assistant, not a replacement for understanding or implementing the logic.
Overall, AI enhanced productivity but still required strong manual oversight, decision-making, and debugging to ensure the application met all required specifications.
